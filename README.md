## Setup

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

**Configure the the .env File**

First, you should have an `.env` file.
If you don't, copy `.env.dist` to create it.

Next, look at the configuration and make any adjustments you
need - specifically `DATABASE_URL`.

**Setup the Database**

Again, make sure `.env` is setup for your computer. Then, create
the database & tables!

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

If you get an error that the database exists, that should
be ok. But if you have problems, completely drop the
database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.

**Start server**

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Now check out the api at `http://localhost:8000/api`
